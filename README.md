I build OSS .NET technologies aimed at making it easier to build large-scale applications. 

## âš¡ Work
I'm currently the Founder and CEO of [Petabridge](https://petabridge.com/), a company that provides commercial support, training, and tooling for [Akka.NET](https://getakka.net/), one of the OSS projects I founded. We create products like [Phobos Akka.NET APM](https://phobos.petabridge.com/), [Petabridge.Cmd Akka.NET CLI](https://cmd.petabridge.com/), and OSS tools such as [NBench - .NET Performance Testing](https://nbench.io/).
